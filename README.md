# lankytinu_objektu_atpazinimas


This Android application, created as part of a student project, is designed to recognize Lithuania landmark objects in images using machine learning models. Developed using TensorFlow Lite, the app allows users to either capture photos or upload existing images for object detection. Upon analysis, the app provides real-time feedback on the identified objects and offers additional information about them. Through this project, I aimed to explore the integration of machine learning into mobile applications while gaining practical experience in Android app development.
